# USER-ACTIVITY-ANALYSIS-TO-DETECT-BORDERLINE-BOTS-IN-TWITTER
In this work, we have considered only the user behaviors to detect Twitter Bots. The Research experiment includes a real time Twitter dataset collected through Twitter API. We model the user behaviors as DNA sequence and design TF-IDF and Information gain (Entropy) based approach to analyze borderline bots from humans. The Essence of our proposed work identifies bots from humans through the entropy estimate on DNA sequences, which acts as the indicator for automation.
